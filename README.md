<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

"eventio" is an event booking app that allows users to discover and book various events in the city they live and love, filtering per several criterias like proximity, type of event, number of attendees, etc. The app aims to provide a seamless user experience and facilitate event management for both organizers and attendees.

Its the final project (Project3) from Web Development-Full Time 2023. As you already can imagine, we have spent so many hours trying to create this amazing final project, which includes all technical requirements requested by the Student Portal.
* Develop a Full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS). 
* Using MERN stack.
* To have a fully functional full-stack application.
* Using Agile methodologies and participating in Agile rituals, such as daily stand-ups.

So, in conclusion:

* Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
* Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that our React app will communicate with.
Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
* Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of our app.
* Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social login) and authorization (logged-in users can do additional things).
* Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for frontend React application and the other is for our backend REST API.
* Have at least 2 commits per day that we worked on.
* Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in our REST API.
* Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use our app.
